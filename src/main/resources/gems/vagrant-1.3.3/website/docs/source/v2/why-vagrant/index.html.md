# Why Vagrant?

Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments
built on top of industry-standard technology and
controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity
and flexibility of you and your team.

To achieve its magic, Vagrant stands on the shoulders of giants. Machines
are provisioned on top of VirtualBox, VMware, AWS, or
[any other provider](/v2/providers/index.html). Then, industry-standard
[provisioning tools](/v2/provisioning/index.html)
such as shell scripts, Chef, or Puppet, can be used to automatically install
and configure software on the machine.

## How Vagrant Benefits You

If you're a **developer**, Vagrant will isolate dependencies and their
configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without
sacrificing any of the tools you're used to working with (editors, browsers,
debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single [Vagrantfile](/v2/vagrantfile/index.html), you just need to `vagrant up` and everything is installed and
configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their
development environments from the same configuration, so whether you're working
on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, all your team members are running code in
the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same way.
Say goodbye to "works on my machine" bugs.

If you're an **operations engineer**, Vagrant gives you a disposable environment
and consistent workflow for developing and testing infrastructure management
scripts. You can quickly test things like shell scripts, Chef cookbooks,
Puppet modules, and more using local virtualization such as VirtualBox or
VMware. Then, with the _same configuration_, you can test these scripts
on remote clouds such as AWS or RackSpace with the _same workflow_. Ditch
your custom scripts to recycle EC2 instances, stop juggling SSH prompts
to various machines, and start using Vagrant to bring sanity to your life.

If you're a **designer**, Vagrant will automatically setup everything required
for that web app in order for you to focus on doing what you do best:
design. Once a developer configures Vagrant, you don't need to worry about
how to get that app running ever again. No more bothering other developers
to help you fix your environment so you can test designs. Just check out the
code, `vagrant up`, and start designing.
